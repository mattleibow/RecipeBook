# RecipeBook
A collection of great recipes organized as daily story-driven cooking adventures.

## Structure

Recipes are organized by date in a year/month/day folder structure:
```
YYYY/MM/DD/recipe-name.md
```

Each recipe tells a story that connects to the broader narrative, creating a continuous journey of cooking, healing, and connection.
