# Celebration Sourdough Focaccia with Garden Herbs

## A Story of Full Circle and Grateful Hearts

There are moments that mark not just the end of a chapter but the recognition that you have completed a full revolution around the sun of your own transformation. As I stood in my kitchen on this particular day, exactly one month since I had begun this intentional journey of adding recipes to my collection, I realized that what had started as a simple project had become something much more profound—a year-long exploration of how food, community, and healing could interweave to create a life that was not just recovered from loss, but enriched by it.

The sourdough starter that had been my first teacher in patience and faith sat bubbling on my counter, mature now and reliable, ready to transform simple flour and water into something magical through the alchemy of time and care. It seemed fitting to return to bread—where my cooking journey had truly begun with my grandmother's memory bread—but this time to create something celebratory, something that could feed a crowd, something that honored both where I had been and where I was going.

Focaccia felt perfect for this moment—generous and welcoming, designed for sharing, beautiful in its rustic simplicity. Using my sourdough starter instead of commercial yeast would create something more complex, more personal, more connected to the long tradition of bread-making that had sustained my family for generations. The herbs would come from Mrs. Chen's garden, now flourishing under her care and mine, carrying with them the story of our friendship and the community we had built together.

As I mixed the dough, feeling its texture change from shaggy to smooth under my hands, I thought about all the lessons these months of cooking had taught me. Patience from the risottos and braises, courage from the unfamiliar cuisines, acceptance from the imperfect galettes, joy from the shared desserts, strength from the nourishing grain salads. Each recipe had been both sustenance and teacher, both comfort and challenge.

The beauty of focaccia lay in its forgiving nature—the way the dough could be stretched and dimpled without perfect technique, the way the toppings could be arranged with rustic charm rather than studied precision. As I drizzled olive oil into the dimples I had pressed with my fingertips, scattering fresh rosemary and thyme and sage across the surface like confetti, I understood that this bread represented everything I had learned about embracing imperfection while still striving for beauty.

When our extended chosen family gathered for what had become our celebration dinner—Mrs. Chen and her husband, Elena and her sister who was visiting, Sarah with her new boyfriend, Tom with his quiet smile, Ji-hye with banchan to share, even some neighbors who had been drawn into our expanding circle of connection—the focaccia emerged from the oven golden and fragrant, its surface glistening with herb-infused oil, its texture light and airy with just enough chew to feel substantial.

As we broke bread together—literally tearing pieces from the warm focaccia, dipping them in good olive oil, sharing stories and laughter and the comfortable silences that come between people who have witnessed each other's growth—I realized that this was exactly what my grandmother would have wanted for me. Not that I would avoid grief or pain, but that I would transform it into something nourishing, something that fed not just myself but a whole community of people who had become family through the simple act of sharing meals together.

The focaccia disappeared quickly, each piece carrying with it the flavors of the herbs we had grown together, the love we had shared, the community we had built one meal at a time. And as I looked around at these faces that had become so dear to me, I understood that this bread—imperfect but beautiful, simple but satisfying, generous but grounded—was the perfect representation of the life I had built from the ashes of loss: rich with flavor, abundant with love, and always, always ready to be shared.

## Ingredients

### For the Sourdough Focaccia:
- 1 cup active sourdough starter
- 1¼ cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 3 cups bread flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar

### For the Herb Topping:
- ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh sage, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh oregano
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- Flaky sea salt for finishing
- Black pepper

### Optional Additional Toppings:
- Cherry tomatoes, halved
- Red onion, thinly sliced
- Kalamata olives, pitted
- Coarse sea salt

## Instructions

### Making the Dough:
1. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together active starter, warm water, and 2 tablespoons olive oil.

2. **Add Dry Ingredients**: Add both flours, salt, and sugar. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.

3. **Knead Gently**: Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead for 5-8 minutes until smooth and elastic.

4. **First Rise**: Place in oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 2-3 hours until doubled (sourdough takes longer than commercial yeast).

### Shaping and Second Rise:
5. **Prepare Pan**: Generously oil a large rimmed baking sheet or 9x13 inch pan.

6. **Shape the Focaccia**: Gently transfer dough to prepared pan and stretch to fit, pressing into corners. Don't worry if it springs back—let it rest and try again.

7. **Second Rise**: Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours until puffy and jiggly when gently shaken.

### Topping and Baking:
8. **Preheat Oven**: Heat oven to 425°F (220°C).

9. **Prepare Herb Oil**: Mix olive oil with chopped herbs and sliced garlic. Let infuse while dough finishes rising.

10. **Dimple and Top**: Using fingertips, create dimples all over the surface of the dough. Drizzle generously with herb oil, making sure it pools in the dimples.

11. **Add Final Touches**: Scatter any additional toppings and sprinkle with flaky salt and black pepper.

12. **Bake to Golden**: Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown on top and sounds hollow when tapped.

13. **Cool and Serve**: Let cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting. Serve warm or at room temperature.

## Tips for Perfect Sourdough Focaccia

- **Starter Activity**: Ensure your starter is active and bubbly—this may take longer to rise than regular focaccia.
- **Hydration Matters**: The dough should be quite wet and sticky—this creates the characteristic airy texture.
- **Gentle Handling**: Don't overwork the dough when shaping—focaccia should be rustic and relaxed.
- **Oil Generously**: Don't be shy with the olive oil—it creates the crispy bottom and keeps herbs from burning.
- **Dimpling Technique**: Press firmly with fingertips to create deep dimples that will hold oil and toppings.
- **Herb Timing**: Add delicate herbs in the last 10 minutes to prevent burning.
