# Heavenly Cinnamon Pancakes with Honey

## A Story of Healing and New Beginnings

Time had passed since I discovered the healing power of baking through those transformative brownies, and while they had helped me through my darkest days, I found myself craving something different—something that spoke to hope and new beginnings rather than just comfort. It was a crisp morning, the kind where golden sunlight streams through kitchen windows and makes everything feel possible again. I had been feeling restless, like I was ready to turn a new page in my life, but I wasn't quite sure how.

As I stood in my now-familiar kitchen, surrounded by the mixing bowls and measuring cups that had become my trusted companions, I remembered a phone call with my childhood friend Sarah. She had been going through her own difficult time—a painful divorce that had left her questioning everything she thought she knew about herself. Through tears, she had told me about the mornings she used to spend as a child, helping her father make his famous cinnamon pancakes while her mother slept in. "I wish I could feel that safe and loved again," she had whispered.

I decided to recreate those childhood pancakes for both of us. I wanted to capture that feeling of being completely cared for, of leisurely mornings when the biggest worry was whether to drizzle honey in patterns or pools. As I whisked together the batter, folding in cinnamon with the same gentle care I had learned from making those brownies, I realized this recipe wasn't just about pancakes—it was about creating a space for healing, for hope, and for the sweet promise that no matter how difficult things get, there are still moments of pure joy to be found. When Sarah arrived and took her first bite, tears streaming down her face as she tasted childhood comfort mixed with present-day strength, I knew these pancakes would become more than just a recipe. They became our symbol of resilience, our ritual of choosing joy, and a reminder that sometimes the most profound healing happens over a stack of golden, cinnamon-kissed pancakes drizzled with golden honey.

## Ingredients

### For the Pancakes:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1¾ cups whole milk
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter for cooking

### For the Cinnamon Sugar Topping:
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

### For Serving:
- High-quality honey (preferably local or wildflower)
- Additional butter
- Fresh berries (optional)
- Whipped cream (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparing the Pancakes:

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt until well combined.

2. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then whisk in milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract until smooth.

3. **Combine Batter**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Don't overmix—a few lumps are perfectly fine and will result in fluffier pancakes.

4. **Rest the Batter**: Let the batter rest for 5 minutes while you heat the pan. This allows the flour to hydrate and creates more tender pancakes.

5. **Heat the Pan**: Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with oil or butter.

6. **Make Cinnamon Sugar**: While the pan heats, mix together the ¼ cup sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon in a small bowl.

7. **Cook Pancakes**: Pour ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the heated skillet. Immediately sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon sugar over each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and edges look set (about 2-3 minutes), then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.

8. **Keep Warm**: Transfer cooked pancakes to a warm oven (200°F) to keep them hot while you finish the batch.

9. **Serve with Love**: Stack the pancakes on warm plates, drizzle generously with honey, and add a pat of butter. Serve immediately while they're still steaming.

## Tips for Perfect Cinnamon Pancakes

- **Don't Overmix**: Lumpy batter makes fluffy pancakes. Overmixing develops the gluten and creates tough, dense pancakes.
- **Temperature Matters**: Medium heat is key. Too hot and they'll burn on the outside while staying raw inside.
- **Fresh Cinnamon**: Use fresh, high-quality ground cinnamon for the best flavor. It makes a noticeable difference.
- **Honey Selection**: Choose a good honey—it's the star of this dish. Local honey adds beautiful complexity.
- **Make Ahead**: You can make the dry ingredients ahead of time. Just add wet ingredients when ready to cook.
- **Freezer Friendly**: These pancakes freeze beautifully. Cool completely, then freeze in a single layer before transferring to freezer bags.
