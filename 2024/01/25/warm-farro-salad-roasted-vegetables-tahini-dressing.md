# Warm Farro Salad with Roasted Vegetables and Tahini Dressing

## A Story of Nourishment and Looking Forward

As the weeks turned into months and my grief began to settle into something more manageable—not gone, but integrated into the ongoing fabric of my life—I found myself drawn to dishes that felt both nourishing and energizing, foods that seemed to whisper promises of renewal and strength. There was something about grain-based salads that spoke to this new phase of healing: substantial enough to feel satisfying, fresh enough to feel hopeful, complex enough to keep me interested.

The inspiration came during one of those conversations with Ji-hye where food became a bridge to deeper topics. She had been sharing her own experience of building a new life in a foreign country, of the way certain dishes had helped her feel grounded even when everything else felt uncertain. "I think healing food isn't just about comfort," she said thoughtfully as we cleaned up after another shared meal. "Sometimes it's about food that makes you feel capable of tomorrow."

Her words stayed with me as I planned our next gathering, and I found myself wanting to create something that embodied that forward-looking quality—a dish that acknowledged where I had been but focused on where I was going. Farro seemed perfect: an ancient grain with a satisfying chewiness, nutty flavor, and the kind of nutritional density that felt like fuel for whatever came next.

The process of making this salad became a meditation on abundance and possibility. Roasting vegetables until they were caramelized and sweet—butternut squash that became jammy at the edges, Brussels sprouts that crisped like tiny cabbages, red onions that turned purple and tender. Each vegetable transformed in the heat, becoming more than it had started as, which felt like an appropriate metaphor for my own journey.

While the vegetables roasted, I cooked the farro until it was tender but still had bite, then tossed it warm with a tahini dressing that Elena had helped me perfect—nutty and creamy with bright lemon juice and enough garlic to make it interesting. The warm grains absorbed the dressing beautifully, becoming glossy and flavorful while still maintaining their individual texture.

When Sarah, Tom, Mrs. Chen, and Ji-hye gathered around my table that evening, the salad was still warm from the oven, the roasted vegetables glistening with olive oil, the farro glossy with tahini dressing, everything topped with pomegranate seeds that burst like tiny jewels and fresh herbs that added color and brightness. It was a dish that looked as vibrant as it tasted, that spoke of abundance and health and the kind of nourishment that builds rather than just comforts.

As we shared the salad—each forkful a perfect combination of chewy grains, sweet roasted vegetables, creamy dressing, and bright pomegranate—the conversation naturally turned to plans and possibilities, to the projects we wanted to tackle and the adventures we hoped to have. The food seemed to inspire this forward-looking energy, to remind us that nourishment could be both grounding and energizing, both comfort and fuel.

Looking around at my chosen family, seeing how our individual healing journeys had woven together into something stronger and more beautiful than any of us could have created alone, I understood that this salad represented exactly where I was in my own recovery: not forgetting the past, but using it as foundation for building something new, something nourishing, something full of possibility and hope.

## Ingredients

### For the Roasted Vegetables:
- 2 cups butternut squash, cubed
- 1 lb Brussels sprouts, halved
- 1 large red onion, sliced into wedges
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika

### For the Farro:
- 1½ cups farro (preferably semi-pearled)
- 4 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon salt

### For the Tahini Dressing:
- ¼ cup tahini
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 2-3 tablespoons warm water
- Salt to taste

### For Assembly:
- ½ cup pomegranate seeds
- ¼ cup toasted pine nuts
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh mint, chopped
- 2 oz goat cheese, crumbled (optional)

## Instructions

### Roasting the Vegetables:
1. **Preheat Oven**: Heat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment.

2. **Prepare Vegetables**: Cut butternut squash into 1-inch cubes, halve Brussels sprouts, and slice onion into wedges.

3. **Season and Roast**: Toss vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika. Spread on baking sheets in single layer.

4. **Roast Until Caramelized**: Roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway through, until vegetables are tender and golden.

### Cooking the Farro:
5. **Toast for Flavor**: In a medium saucepan, toast farro over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.

6. **Add Liquid**: Add stock, bay leaf, and salt. Bring to a boil.

7. **Simmer**: Reduce heat and simmer partially covered for 25-30 minutes until tender but still chewy.

8. **Drain**: Remove bay leaf and drain any excess liquid.

### Making the Tahini Dressing:
9. **Whisk Together**: In a small bowl, whisk tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and maple syrup.

10. **Adjust Consistency**: Add warm water gradually until dressing reaches desired consistency—it should be creamy but pourable.

11. **Season**: Add salt to taste.

### Assembling the Salad:
12. **Combine Warm**: In a large bowl, toss warm farro with half the tahini dressing.

13. **Add Vegetables**: Gently fold in roasted vegetables while they're still warm.

14. **Finish**: Top with pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, fresh herbs, and goat cheese if using.

15. **Serve**: Serve immediately while warm, with remaining dressing on the side.

## Tips for Perfect Farro Salad

- **Farro Varieties**: Semi-pearled farro cooks fastest; whole grain farro takes longer but has more nutrition.
- **Vegetable Timing**: Cut vegetables uniformly for even roasting—harder vegetables may need a head start.
- **Dressing Temperature**: Toss farro with dressing while warm for better absorption.
- **Make Ahead**: This salad keeps well for 2-3 days and can be served warm or at room temperature.
- **Tahini Quality**: Use fresh, well-stirred tahini for the smoothest dressing.
- **Seasonal Variations**: Adapt vegetables based on season—root vegetables in winter, asparagus and peas in spring.
