# Butternut Squash and Sage Ravioli

## A Story of Creating Beauty from Scratch

There comes a moment in every cook's journey when you realize that the techniques that once seemed impossibly complex are actually within reach, that the dishes you admired from afar can become accessible through patience, practice, and the willingness to embrace imperfection. Making fresh pasta had always felt like one of those mysterious arts—something beautiful that happened in other people's kitchens, requiring skills and intuition I wasn't sure I possessed.

But something about the slow process of healing had given me a new relationship with time and patience. The urgency that once characterized my approach to learning had been replaced by a gentler curiosity, a willingness to try things not because I needed to prove anything, but because the process itself seemed like it might be nourishing. When Elena mentioned that her grandmother had made fresh ravioli every holiday, and offered to teach me the technique, I found myself saying yes without the usual flutter of anxiety.

We spent an entire afternoon in my kitchen, Elena's hands guiding mine through the meditative process of making pasta dough—forming a well of flour, cracking eggs into the center, slowly incorporating everything with a fork until it formed a shaggy mass that would be transformed through kneading. The rhythm of working the dough, folding and pressing and turning, felt therapeutic in a way I hadn't expected, like a form of meditation that engaged both body and mind.

While the dough rested, wrapped in plastic and developing its silky texture, we prepared the filling—roasted butternut squash that had become sweet and caramelized in the oven, mixed with ricotta and Parmesan, seasoned with nutmeg and sage until it tasted like autumn concentrated into a single spoonful. The filling was the color of sunset, rich and creamy and perfumed with herbs that Mrs. Chen had dried from her garden.

Rolling the pasta thin enough to see through required a patience I was still learning to cultivate, but Elena's gentle guidance kept me from becoming frustrated when the sheets tore or the thickness wasn't perfectly even. "Nonna always said that homemade pasta should look homemade," she reminded me when I worried about imperfections. "The irregularities are what make it special, what tell the story of the hands that made it."

Assembling the ravioli became a kind of assembly line meditation—placing spoonfuls of filling at regular intervals, brushing the pasta with beaten egg, folding over the top sheet and pressing out air bubbles, cutting each pillow with a wheel that left decorative crimped edges. Some were perfectly square, others charmingly lopsided, but each one represented a small victory, a moment when intention became reality.

When Sarah and Tom arrived for dinner, the ravioli were swimming in a simple sauce of brown butter and crispy sage leaves, the pasta tender and delicate, the filling sweet and savory and perfectly seasoned. Each bite was a revelation—the way the pasta melted on the tongue, the way the butternut squash filling provided richness without heaviness, the way the sage added an earthy complexity that tied everything together.

But beyond the flavors, what moved me most was the realization that I had created something beautiful from the simplest ingredients—flour, eggs, vegetables, herbs—transformed through technique and patience into something that felt like a small miracle. As we lingered over dinner, twirling pasta around our forks and marveling at what we had accomplished together, I understood that this was what recovery looked like: not a dramatic transformation, but a gradual reclaiming of confidence, one small victory at a time.

## Ingredients

### For the Pasta Dough:
- 2 cups 00 flour (or all-purpose flour)
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Semolina flour for dusting

### For the Butternut Squash Filling:
- 2 lbs butternut squash, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup whole milk ricotta
- ½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 12 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- 1 egg yolk (for richness)

### For the Brown Butter Sage Sauce:
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 16-20 fresh sage leaves
- ¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### For Assembly:
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
- Semolina flour for dusting

## Instructions

### Making the Pasta Dough:
1. **Create the Well**: On a clean work surface, mound flour and make a deep well in the center.

2. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Crack eggs into the well, add olive oil and salt.

3. **Incorporate Gradually**: Using a fork, gradually mix flour into eggs until a shaggy dough forms.

4. **Knead with Intention**: Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should spring back when poked.

5. **Rest**: Wrap in plastic wrap and rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.

### Preparing the Filling:
6. **Roast the Squash**: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss cubed squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and lightly caramelized.

7. **Make the Filling**: Mash roasted squash until smooth. Mix with ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, nutmeg, chopped sage, and egg yolk. Season with salt and white pepper.

8. **Cool Completely**: Let filling cool completely before using.

### Rolling and Assembling:
9. **Roll the Pasta**: Divide dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece through pasta machine from widest to thinnest setting, or roll by hand until very thin.

10. **Cut Sheets**: Cut pasta into sheets about 4 inches wide and 12 inches long.

11. **Fill the Ravioli**: Place spoonfuls of filling 2 inches apart on one sheet. Brush around filling with egg wash.

12. **Seal**: Cover with second sheet, press around each mound to seal, removing air bubbles.

13. **Cut and Crimp**: Cut into individual ravioli using a knife or pasta wheel. Crimp edges to seal completely.

### Cooking and Serving:
14. **Boil Water**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil.

15. **Make the Sauce**: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat until it turns golden brown and smells nutty. Add sage leaves and fry until crispy.

16. **Cook Ravioli**: Cook ravioli for 3-4 minutes until they float to the surface and are tender.

17. **Combine**: Using a slotted spoon, transfer ravioli directly to the brown butter sauce.

18. **Finish**: Add a splash of pasta water, toss gently, and serve immediately with grated cheese.

## Tips for Perfect Homemade Ravioli

- **Dough Consistency**: The dough should be smooth and not sticky—adjust with flour or water as needed.
- **Thin Rolling**: Roll pasta thin enough to see your hand through it for the most delicate texture.
- **Proper Sealing**: Ensure edges are well-sealed to prevent filling from leaking during cooking.
- **Gentle Cooking**: Use a gentle boil to prevent delicate pasta from breaking apart.
- **Fresh vs Dried**: Fresh ravioli cook much faster than dried—watch carefully to avoid overcooking.
- **Make Ahead**: Assembled ravioli can be frozen on trays and stored for up to a month.
